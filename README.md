# Gear
This is where I keep my gear, cause people keep asking

## Day to Day stuff

## [Veno Shopping Bags](https://amzn.to/4bkPmLX)

Every time I checkout using these bags, the cashier and bagger (if there is one) comments on how great they are. Sturdy, stand up by themselves, and large enough for almost any item. Highly recommend


## Ergonomic Essentials

### Roost Laptop Stand
This thing will save your spine. Do not work hunched over a laptop. You will need a keyboard and mouse to go with it

### Keyboard
Features: Bluetooth, usb-charging, full-size, backlit, folds up

### Mouse
OSX? Magic mouse. Yup. Gestures for mission control are too good to pass up when confined to a tiny screen

## Packing

### Weekend / 3 day trip Bag
Goruck GR2
https://www.goruck.com/collections/best-sellers/products/gr2

### Packing cubes
Packing cubes add minimal weight but a lot of capacity to your back thanks to compression. 
The organization also makes packing and unpacking a breeze. I usually leave my "carry-on" cube packed with 1 shirt, 1 shorts, 2 underwear and 1 socks and literally never open it unless my checked bag gets lost
Again here it doesn't really matter which brand you go with, Eagle Creek is just what I went with, because I particularly liked the hook hanger toiletry bag

#### Clean / Dirty Cube
The cube I use most, keeps the smelly stuff isolated from the rest of your stuff. Machine washable.

#### Toiletry bag
Another sub-bag that you never need to unpack
https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F9S91FI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

#### Packing cube starter set
The storage for dress shirts and pants is great and keeps them relatively wrinkle free (See #cloths_steamer for more on how to look sharp)

### Hand held portable Steamer
Again, no brand endorsements here. But having one of these saves you from having to use the hotel iron, which is likely to ruin your shirts / pants

## When you can choose to Be Batman, always Be Batman
When you don't know what you are connecting to, or what kind of connections you need, you need to embrace the dongle

### Wire/dongle organizer
Again get whatever you like here, I like this one. Turn wire soup into neat and organized
https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B078M9L8XN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

### USB-C "Dock"
Works with OSX, gets you a lot of connectivity in a small package
https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B071G83L1J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

###  Anker 4 port USB charger
There is always a "newer" model of this thing, so check and figure out how much wattage you need. This can confortably charge a phone, laptop, watch and spare battery
https://smile.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Foldable-PowerPort-Samsung/dp/B00VH8ENXE/

### Spare USB Battery
You already knew you needed this when traveling. Pro-tip, airport vending machines usually have pre-charged ones

### 3 tipped charger
This random chinesium charge cable is great to keep in the quick access pocket of your bag and rolls up real neat. A bit fragile though.
2-Pack ASICEN Retractable Multiple 3A Fast Charging Cable

### One to Three outlet cube
small, versatile, no wires to tangle never run out of outlets at the airport
https://smile.amazon.com/GE-Adapter-Grounded-Outlet-58368

## Entertainment

Wireless Headphones. Over the ear, and noise cancelling for the best airplane experience.
### Sony Wh1000xm4 
Slightly better bass than the bose
https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/wh1000xm4-w

### Bose QuietComfortÂ® 45 headphones 
The leader in noise cancelling, but a little tinny sounding imho.
https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/quietcomfort-headphones-45.html#v=qc45_black

### Nintendo Switch
Never be board on a plane again. If you've never played Zelda before, now's your chance jerk!

### Roku
Get a small one and stick one of these into your dongle bag and avoid having to sign into netflix, amazon, and everything else every time you land at a new hotel. Bonus, no need to use that gross remote control the hotel has. Make sure you have a long hdmi cable to go with.

### Kindle
Books are weight. If you don't like reading on your phone get a kinda or other ereader. Make sure you know how to sideload ebooks onto it.

## Hacking Gear
For all my hackers out there.

## Other tips
* Just unplug the goddamn mini fridge so you can sleep
* Some air conditioner units have secret control menu's that you have to use to get the room cooler / warmer than the "Soft limit" the hotel sets.
* On day 1 of a long trip, go to the supermarket or something and get snacks and stuff. Charge it to the company card.
* Don't be afraid to bring home snacks from the office supply, its usually a cost savings for you clients and they generally don't mind
* Always charge meals to your room to make expense reports easier
* Set up integration between lyft and concur so that your reciepts automatically get pulled into concur
* Check with the hotel staff before walking somewhere, they can steer you around construction or unsafe parts of town.
